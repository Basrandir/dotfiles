#+TITLE: Alacritty
#+AUTHOR: Bassam Saeed

My terminal emulator of choice. Still need to evaluate kitty.

* History
  Gnome Terminal -> urxvt -> termite -> urxvt -> st -> xst ->
  alacritty
* Fonts
  Still don't understand why the point size has to be so much higher
  in alacritty to match the equivalent in st and/or rofi.
