The idea here is to explicitly define default graphical
applications. The default ~XDG MIME specifications~ is a little obtuse
to configure without the help of a desktop environment managing it for
you. So this was an easy way to handle that.

Put the path of this file (usually ~$HOME/bin~) ahead of the standard
~xdg-open~ path in the ~$PATH~ environment variable.

#+begin_src bash
  case "${1%%:*}" in
      http|https) exec firefox "$1"
		  ;;
      ,*) exec /usr/bin/xdg-open "$@"
	 ;;
  esac
#+end_src
