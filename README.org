#+TITLE: System and User Configuration
* TODO Get .password-store folder cloned
My passwords are stored in a private repo, ~Guix Home~ should ensure the
folder exists locally and if not, clone it.
* TODO Ensure mail folders are created
The ~mbsync~ command requires the existence of the appropriate mail
folders as defined in the ~.mbsyncrc~ configuration file. In this case,
I want to make sure ~Guix Home~ ensures the creation of the ~~/.mail~
folder and appropriate subdirectories.
