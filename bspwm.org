[[https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm][ï‚Ž  bspwm]] is an automatic tiling window manager.

* Pseudo Desktop Environment
  Some comforts
** Cursor
   Have the mouse cursor show up as a standard pointer.
   
   #+begin_src bash
     xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr &
   #+end_src
** Who needs capslock
   Remap capslock to be Control when held, Esc when tapped.

   #+begin_src bash
     setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier'
     xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape'
   #+end_src
** Keybindings
   bspwm by itself does not come with any key (or mouse) handling. So
   we use another application by the same developer; sxhkd.

   #+begin_src bash
     sxhkd &
   #+end_src
** Monitor setup
   Polaris has 1 primary monitor and then a 165hz secondary on the
   right side in a vertical alignment.

   #+begin_src bash :tangle (if (equal (system-name) "polaris") "~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc" "no")
     xrandr --output HDMI-A-0 --primary --auto --output DisplayPort-0 --auto --mode 1920x1080 --rate 165.00 --right-of HDMI-A-0 --rotate right
   #+end_src
** Wallpaper
   Restore wallpaper previously set

   #+begin_src bash
     setroot --restore
   #+end_src
** My eyes... they burn
   Using redshift to handle blue light and general colour temperature
   of monitor throughout the day.

   #+begin_src bash
     redshift &
   #+end_src
** Compositor
   As a window manager, bspwm doesn't include it's own compositor. I
   only use it for fairly basic stuff.
   #+begin_src bash
     picom -b
   #+end_src
* BSPC
  Now for the actual setup of the windowing environment. Below are
  some general settings I prefer.

  #+begin_src bash
    bspc config border_width         2
    bspc config window_gap          10

    bspc config split_ratio          0.50
    bspc config borderless_monocle   true
    bspc config gapless_monocle      true
  #+end_src
** Workspaces
   5 per monitor makes sense for me and works well.

   #+begin_src bash
     for monitor in $(bspc query -M); do
	 bspc monitor $monitor -d I II III IV V
     done
   #+end_src
** Rules
   Specific window rules that I want to enforce for applications
   beyond just the bspwm defaults. Specifically, for some reason Emacs
   is the only application I know that isn't tiled by
   default. Probably something to do with how weird and archaic its
   GUI codebase is.

   #+begin_src bash
     bspc rule -a Firefox desktop=^1
     bspc rule -a Emacs state=tiled
     bspc rule -a mpv state=floating
   #+end_src
