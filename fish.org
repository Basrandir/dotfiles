My shell of choice is fish. Instead of just copy pasting the contents
of the fish configuration directory, I'm just having ~fisher~ handle it
for me since I haven't made any manual changes to my config.

This file isn't tangled since that's not needed. Instead I'm executing
the source blocks directly. A potential downside to this is on systems
where ~fisher~ isn't installed, or is hard to install.

* TODO Ensure Fisher is installed

* Prompt
  I like the [[https://github.com/pure-fish/pure][ï‚Ž pure]] prompt for fish.

  #+name: install-pure-shell
  #+begin_src fish :tangle no
    fisher install pure-fish/pure
  #+end_src
  
  #+CALL: install-pure-shell()

* direnv
  Trigger ~direnv~ at prompt on directory change
  #+begin_src fish
    direnv hook fish | source
  #+end_src
* PATH
  Add ~$HOME/bin~ to ~$PATH~ environment variable

  #+begin_src fish :tangle no
    fish_add_path -p /home/bassam/bin
  #+end_src
* Aliases
  Fish aliases are defined as functions that are autoloaded.

  #+begin_src fish :tangle ~/.config/fish/functions/ls.fish
    function ls --wraps=exa --description 'alias ls=exa'
	exa $argv;
    end
  #+end_src
