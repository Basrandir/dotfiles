Currently I'm using ~neomutt~ to handle all my mail needs. This
includes, fetching, syncing, filtering and sending mail.

* IMAP
  This section describes how we fetch mail.

  #+begin_src bash
    set folder = "imaps://imap.gmail.com"

    set imap_user = "daisuke2@gmail.com"
    set imap_pass = `pass mail/gmail/mutt`

    set   imap_check_subscribed
    unset imap_passive
    set   mail_check = 120
  #+end_src
* SMTP
  This section describes how we send mail.

  #+begin_src bash
    set smtp_url  = "smtps://bassam.saeed@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com"
    set smtp_pass = `pass mail/gmail/mutt`

    set realname = "Bassam Saeed"
    set from     = "daisuke2@gmail.com"

    set edit_headers = yes
  #+end_src
* Locations
  Defines where we store the message and header caches.

  #+begin_src bash
    set header_cache     = "~/.config/neomutt/cache/headers"
    set message_cachedir = "~/.config/neomutt/cache/bodies"
    set mailcap_path     = "~/.config/neomutt/mailcap"
  #+end_src
* Folders
  Gmail has a specific setup for its folders. Here I'm getting just
  the core, important ones. Not going to bother with SPAM, and labels
  I'll deal with locally.

  #+begin_src bash
    set spoolfile = "+INBOX"
    set postponed = "+[Gmail]/Drafts"
    set trash     = "+[Gmail]/Trash"
  #+end_src
* UI
  Since HTML email has become so prevalant, I want to prioritize plain
  text version of email if it exists. Then we fallback on trying to
  have mutt display the HTML email.

  #+begin_src bash
    alternative_order text/plain text/html
    auto_view text/html
  #+end_src

  By default mutt sorts new mail at the bottom of the list. I don't
  like that.

  #+begin_src bash
    set sort = reverse-date-received
  #+end_src
* Colours

  #+begin_src bash
    color index red default ~P
  #+end_src
